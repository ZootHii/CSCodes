Access Modifiers: 
 - Private = it is the default type, we can only access from the block where its defined
 - Public = we can access from everywhere
 - Protected = we can access from its class and derived (extended, inherited) classes from this class
 - Internal = can be accessed only from the same program, project (like .exe, .dll)

Static: // C# Course 17.5
    Used for common objects, things
 - Static Class = Can not make an instance of that class
 
 * Making instance means making new object (newlemek) and this process is expensive 
 
Reference and Value Types:
 - Reference Type = Classes, interfaces, abstracts, Strings, arrays, lists,
 - Value Type = in C# (string is a value type), int
 
 Type Safe = <string, int, ...> like (ArrayList<String> this is for java in C# List<string>)
